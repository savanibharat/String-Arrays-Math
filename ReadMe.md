# Strings-Arrays-Math

This repository is created by one idea in mind which is "Create as many as utility functions so Developer can easily use them."

Three types of Utility classes are created.

  - String 
   * [String Utility] [String Utility]
   * [String Methods Blog] [String Methods Blog]
  - Math 
   * [Arithmetic] [Math Utility 1]
   * [Shape] [Math Utility 2]
  - Arrays [Array Utility] [Array Utility]

There are *several functions* written in this utlity classes but *more* are yet to be added.
### Todo's

 - Write Tests
 - Built more utility methods
 - Add Code Comments
 - Add method explanation blog
